                        <p>As Conference Director, Ankit's job is to oversee every single aspect of the conference and to be the face of the event to those who attend. By making sure that every part of the conference runs smoothly and that every attendee, speaker, and company enjoys the experience, his job will be successful.</p>

                        <p>What makes Pulse exciting for Ankit is the consistent evolution over the past five years. This event started as a small conference in three different buildings with an attendance of ~250 people. Since then, the conference has expanded to over 450 attendees all together in one building! He hopes to take this year's conference to the next level and looks forward to returning to the event in the coming years to witness the continued growth.</p>
